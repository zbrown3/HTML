<!--Elements including scripts are parsed in the order they appear in the HTML file.  When the HTML parser encounters a script
element, it loads the script then exectures its contents before parsing the rest of th HTML.  The HTML parser does NOT 
process the next element in the HTML file until it loads and executres the script element, thus leading to a delay in load time
and resulting in a poor user experience.  Scripts are loaded sequentially, so if one script depends on another script,
they should be placed in that very order inside the HTML file. -->
