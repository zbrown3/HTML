* When a user types in a URL and presses enter, the server processes the request and sends the HTML file back to the client.
* The browswer searches the HTML file and makes any additional requests to the server based on any external resources used by the HTML file.
*  Requests can include one or more Cascading Style Sheets.  CSS creates the style and layout of a web page.
* Requests can also include images and videos from server to client that can cause a delay while they are rendered by the browswer.
* One or more Javascript files makes a page interactive.
