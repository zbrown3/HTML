<!--To create a dropdown list the select element is used.  To populate the dropdown list, we add multiple option elements, each with a
value attribute.  By default only one of these options can be selected.  The text rendered is the text included between the opening
and close option tags.  However, it is the value of the value attribute that is used in form submission.  When the form is submitted,
the information from this input field will be sent using the name of the select and the value chosen.-->
