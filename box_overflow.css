/* Overlow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows outside it's box. 
   Common values are: 
   hidden - any content that overflows will be  hidden from view.
   scroll - a scrollbar will be added to the element's box so that rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling. 
   visible - the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. This is the default value. 
   The overflow property is set on a parent element to instruct the broswer on how to render child elements. 
   For example, if a div's overflow property is set to scroll, all children of this dive will display overflowing content with a scroll bar. */
