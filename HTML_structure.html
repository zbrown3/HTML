  <!-- When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. 
       Elements nested at the same level are considered siblings. 
       If there are multiple levels of nesting elements can be grandchildren, great-grandchildren etc.  
       Relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as hierarchy. -->
