<!--The defer attribute specifies scripts should be executed after the HTML file is completely parsed.  
When a the HTML parser encounters a script elementer with the defer attribute, it loads the script but defers the
actual execution of the Javascript until after it finishes parsing the rest of the elements in the HTML file.
When a script contains functionality that requires interaction with the DOM, the defer attribute is used.  This way,
it ensures that the entire HTML file has been parsed before the script is executed.  -->
