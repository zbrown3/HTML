/* Colors can be specified using hexadecimal characters.  a hex color begins with a hash character followed by three or six characters
   The characters represent values for red, blue and green. Hex colors whose number pairs are the same characters can be represented 
   with both three characters and six characters. 
   By adding a two-digit hexadecimal value to the end of the six-digit representation (#52BC8280), 
   or a one-digit hexadecimal value to the end of the three-digit representation (#F003), 
   you can change the opacity of a hexadecimal color. Hex opacity ranges from 00 (transparent) to FF (opaque). */
