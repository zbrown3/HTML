<!--The async attribute loads and executes the script asynchronously with the rest of the webpage.  This means
that, similar to the defer attrbute the HTML parser will continue parsing the rest of the HTML as the script is
downloaded in the background.  However, with the async attribute, the script will not wait until the entire page is parsed:
it will execute immediately after it has been downloaded.  async is useful for scripts that are independent of other scripts
in order to function accordingly.  Thus, if it does not matter exactly at which point the script file is executed, async loading
is the most suitable option as it optimizes the web page load time.  -->
