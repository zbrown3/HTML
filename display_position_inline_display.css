/* Every HTML element has a default display value that dictates if it can share horizontal space with other elements.  
Some elements fill the entire browswer from left to right regardless of the size of their content.  Inline display
is the default display for some elmenets such as <em> <strong> <a>.  Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their
content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. 
The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document.*/
