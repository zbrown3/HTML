<!--Regular expression, or regex is used to check how text was provided.  Regular expressions are a sequence of characters
that make up a search pattern.  If the input matches the regex, the form can be submitted.  In the example to check for a valid
credit card number(14 to 16 digit number), we use the regex: pattern="[0-9]{14,16}".  This checks that the user provided  only numbers
and that they entered at least 14 digits and at most 16 digits. -->
