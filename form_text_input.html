<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="first-text-field" value="already pre-filled">
</form>

<!--input element creates an input field for the form.  input element has a type attribute which determines how it renders on the web
page and what kind of data it can accept.  Text is a value for the type attribute and it renders a text field that users can 
type into.  The default value of type is text.  Name attribute also has to be included because without the name attribute
 information in the input won't be sent when the form is submitted.  After users type into the input element, the value of the value
attribute becomes what is typed into the text field.  The value of the value attribute is paired with the value of the name attribute
and sent as text when the form is submitted. If value has a default value then the input field is prefilled with that value. -->
